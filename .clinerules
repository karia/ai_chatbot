# Project Guidelines

## Git & Branching

- Create a new branch from `main` for each new feature or improvement.
- Make a pull request to `main` branch after finishing a feature or improvement.
- Write commit messages in English.

## Code Style & Patterns

- PEP8 guidelines should be followed for Python code.
- Shellcheck should be used for shell scripts.

## Architecture Decision Records

Create ADRs in /docs/adr for:

-   Major dependency changes
-   Architectural pattern changes
-   New integration patterns
-   Database schema changes

## Security Practices

-   Never commit sensitive files
-   Use environment variables for secrets
-   Keep credentials out of logs and output
